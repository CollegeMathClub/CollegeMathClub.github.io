# Our Purpose

Westlake College Math club aims to help students teach each other the math classes that Westlake doesn't. We plan to start by learning discrete math curriculum, an eclectic subject very useful in computer science. We might continue on to any number of classes, like Differential Equations or Abstract Algebra.

# Meeting Schedule

Meetings will happen in [TBD] at 4:20 PM on Fridays, and may last for about an hour.
