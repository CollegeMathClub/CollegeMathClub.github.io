# Our Purpose

Westlake College Math club aims to help students teach each other the math classes that Westlake doesn't. We plan to start by learning discrete math curriculum, an eclectic subject very useful in computer science. We might continue on to any number of classes, like Differential Equations or Abstract Algebra.

# Meeting Schedule

Meetings will happen in room 301, Ms. Chong's room, at 4:20 PM on Fridays, and may last for about an hour. At meetings, we plan to have discussions, hold competitions, and distribute reviews about that week's topic.

All Eanes ISD students are technically eligible to participate. However, there are certain prerequisites to make sure you get the most out of the discrete math course:
